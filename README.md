# extractFromExcel
I wrote a python script with the use of xlrd, datetime, xlwt packages to extract data from an  excel file. The dilema was that an excel workbook had hundreds of sheets with many different cells containing different types of data. The python script with the use of the packages I just mentioned extracted the data from each cell form each sheet and imported the extracted data to a new sheet in a new excel workbook.
